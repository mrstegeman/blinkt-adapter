# blinkt-adapter
Raspberry Pi Blinkt! (by Pimoroni) adapter add-on for Mozilla IoT Gateway 

The blinkt-adapter creates 8 new devices called "Blinkt! LED 1" .. "Blinkt! LED 8". 
One for each of the 8 RGB LEDS on the Blinkt!. 
The devices have properties for color and level and a convenient On/Off property.

I am not associated with Pimoroni.
